# OA-schedule
- Time schedule table for Charity workers.
- Was made for personal use of my co-workers.
- The purpose is to insert the time schedule of the client who requires Charity help and attach the available assistant worker.
- The busyCheck function was implemented to make sure the assistant is available at required time slot.
- My second project - Now I'm realising there is a lot of things I should have done different, especially with Firebase calls.
